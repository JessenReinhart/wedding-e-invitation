# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing Individual Partner Sections component by converting it from custom CSS to Tailwind CSS, improving its responsive design, and ensuring it displays at full viewport height on mobile devices. The component currently uses extensive custom CSS with media queries and needs to be modernized to use Tailwind's utility-first approach while maintaining its visual appeal and functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Individual Partner Sections component to use Tailwind CSS instead of custom CSS, so that the styling is more maintainable and consistent with modern development practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN refactoring the component THEN the system SHALL replace all custom CSS classes with Tailwind utility classes
2. WHEN converting styles THEN the system SHALL maintain the existing visual appearance and functionality
3. WHEN using Tailwind classes THEN the system SHALL remove dependency on custom CSS media queries
4. WHEN implementing Tailwind styles THEN the system SHALL preserve all loading states, error states, and animations
5. WHEN converting background image handling THEN the system SHALL use Tailwind's background utilities

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the partner sections to display at full viewport height, so that each section takes up the entire screen for an immersive experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL set each partner section to full viewport height (100vh)
2. WHEN displaying on mobile THEN the system SHALL ensure content is properly centered within the viewport
3. WHEN viewing in landscape mode on mobile THEN the system SHALL maintain appropriate height proportions
4. WHEN scrolling between sections THEN the system SHALL provide smooth transitions between full-height sections

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user on any device, I want the partner sections to be fully responsive, so that the content displays optimally across all screen sizes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing on desktop (1200px+) THEN the system SHALL display sections with appropriate height and spacing
2. WHEN viewing on tablet (768px-1199px) THEN the system SHALL adjust layout for optimal tablet viewing
3. WHEN viewing on mobile (below 768px) THEN the system SHALL use full viewport height with mobile-optimized spacing
4. WHEN resizing the browser THEN the system SHALL smoothly adapt to different screen sizes
5. WHEN viewing on different orientations THEN the system SHALL maintain proper layout and readability

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the partner sections to maintain all existing functionality while being more performant, so that I have a smooth browsing experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading partner images THEN the system SHALL maintain the existing image preloading and fallback functionality
2. WHEN images fail to load THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error states with fallback backgrounds
3. WHEN displaying Instagram links THEN the system SHALL preserve all validation and error handling
4. WHEN showing loading states THEN the system SHALL maintain loading indicators and smooth transitions
5. WHEN using Tailwind classes THEN the system SHALL ensure better performance than the previous custom CSS approach
